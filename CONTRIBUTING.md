# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thanks for considering to contribute to this project!

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code Style

Make sure your code *roughly* follows [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and keeps things consistent with the rest of the code:

- sorted imports: [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) is used to sort imports
- static analysis: [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is used to catch some dizziness and keep the source code healthy.
